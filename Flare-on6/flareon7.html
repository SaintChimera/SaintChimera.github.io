Challenge 7: "wopr"<br>
<br>
<br>
We used our own computer hacking skills to "find" this AI on a military supercomputer. It does strongly resemble the classic 1983 movie WarGames. Perhaps life imitates art? If you can find the launch codes for us, we'll let you pass to the next challenge. We promise not to start a thermonuclear war.
<br>
This challenge is cool because its frozen python. One easy way to tell is with strings(i use <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss">floss</a>). There are references to python libraries including "python37.dll".<br>
If we run this, it prints a terminal prompt. The only thing you can do at the terminal is to play the "GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR" game. this prints out a map, asks you to pick a country, then prompts you for the nuclear launch code. This code is obviously what we're looking to reverse

So first we need to extract the python from the exe. For this i use <a href="https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker">python-exe-unpacker</a>
<br>
<br>

<i>output from python-exe-packer</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Its not obvious when first looking at the dump directory what the script that you're looking for is. Its even less obvious here since there is no extension, and the script is not named anything obviously unique. I recieved help from @winnythomas for this part. His extractor pointed him toward the file "pyiboot02_cleanup" whereas mine did not.<br>
<br>
I had a lot of trouble getting utilites to successfully decompile pyiboot02_cleanup but i didn't have trouble decompiling it in a python3 shell, so i made a little script <a href="https://github.com/SaintChimera/SaintChimera.github.io/blob/master/Flare-on6/flareon7_code/dumper.py">dumper</a> that made my life only marginally easier.<br>
<br>
out.py has a poem which takes up most of the file, with the code at the end. There are only 3 functions in this code. "ho" appears to just decode text from hex, and return the object that the hex represents in a passed in dictionary g. fire is an rc4 implementation. and eye strips space and tab characters from the input, searches for 0x9 or 0x20 ({9:0,32:1}.get()) in every returned byte and writes every 7th byte to a BytesIO object. Then eye returns the data.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="flareon7_pics/terminal3.png"/><br>
<i>the encoded data</i><br>
<br>
<br>
fire and eye are both called only at the end, with eye being passed __doc__.encode(). __doc__ is a reference to the data within the executing document, then fire rc4 decrypting it, then the data being lzma decompressed, and last printed.<br>
<br>
There is a trick though! and it uses the function "ho". Just above "eye" the code grabs 2 global attributes, and swaps they're position in the attribute list. To get past this and have the code actually print the script, you just need to comment out the lines that set the attributes.<br>
<br>
Now that we've gotten past the anti-analysis, and we understand the code, we want to get it to print. There is a for loop which wraps the interesting code, and that loop just prevents us from knowing the exact number that gets added to BOUNCE and passed to fire. We will need to change that with to save any attempt to lzma decompress to disk and print whenever it is successful. We will also need to make the key "BOUNCE" available from disk, since the code usually gets it a different way.<br>

<br>
<br>
Hilariously, this code doesn't work as one might expect. The debug output reveals that all values for i fail in some way, but only value 74 gives an error that we can work with. That error is an EOF error. Meaning it read the lzma header correctly and decompressed all the data it was given. It just stopped receiving data before it expected. So I accomydated here and changed the code again to print out the uncompressed output for i=74<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Viewing the data in a hex editor, we see a 7z magic number. If we decompress this with 7z, we still get EOF errors, but data is written to disk anyway. This data is the script that prints our terminal output, and accepts our password. Looking at the end of the script, there is no sign that there is important data cut off from the end.<br>
